  <p>How it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Register online and setup an account </li>
      <li>Fund your account.  The dollars used to fund your account are treated as tax-deductible charitable contributions that are deductible in the current tax year.</li>
      <li>Dollars in your account can be used to wager with other users on anything you chose.</li>
      <li>Lose the wager, and dollars will be shifted from your account to the winner's account.  Win the wager, and dollars will be shifted to your account.</li>
      <li>Keep wagering, or direct the dollars to one of Charity-x's pre-approved charitable organizations (ie: RedCross, United Way, etc.)</li>
      <li>At the end of the day - whether you win or lose - know that your dollars will be allocated to a good cause.</li>
